## **Summary**
This week we had to create something visually interesting using arrays and two functions. While reading about arrays I came across the section about using arrays to store words and I was instantly intrigued so I wanted to build off of that by creating a simple kind of interactive poem by a classic author from my childhood.

## **Steps and Issues**
I first began by choosing my poem and then added the words to my array. Next, I knew i wanted them to move around because them staying in the same place was just boring so I created a function to randomize the x and y positions of the words in the array. After clicking through my array a couple times I knew I needed it to reset once it reached the end so I created a function to reset the array back to index 0 once it reached the last word in the array. Obviously, I wanted to add some color because color makes everything more visually interesting. However, I didn't want to just have one stagnant color. I wanted it to change in sync with the words so I created a variable for color and randomized that as well. In order to get them to both change in time and to slow down the words I had to drastically lower the frame rate. As far as issues go, I had many. However, I always try to figure things out on my own before asking for help and I was able to fix all of my problems with the use of Shiffman's YouTube videos and just some trial and error.

## **Extra**
I feel like I have a much better grasp on functions and arrays but unfortunately I feel like this is the first week I have somewhat understood in weeks. The YouTube videos are a lifesaver because I don't think I really learn anything just from reading the website content. I need live step by step examples to truly understand.
