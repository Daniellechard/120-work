[For Loops](https://daniellechard.github.io/120-work/hw-8/empty-example/)

## **Summary**
This week's homework assignment was to create something using for loops. I choose to create a simple design with circles of pastel colors that move down the screen while scaling up at the same time. I think it is very visually intriguing even in its simplicity.

## **Steps and Issues**
In order to accomplish this weeks homework I read through the homework and then attempted to just play around with for loops to try and gain some semblance of understanding. I have also been using the 'Grasshopper' app on my phone in the hopes of being able to better understand coding. While it has helped, the excerises aren't really geared toward the artistic or creative realm so it is not as helpful as I had initially hoped it would be.

## **Extra**
I intend to continue using the 'Grasshopper' app as it has helped me better understand coding even if only slightly.
