[Monster Sketch](https://daniellechard.github.io/120-work/hw-4/empty-example/)

## **Summary**
This week we were to create a monster sketch so for my monster I chose Mike Wasowski from the movie "Monster's Inc.". I chose to make the background grey so that my monster would stand out more and be the focal point of the sketch. I also deliberately made him slightly off-center because it is more visually interesting to the eyes rather than having him directly centered. I attempted to make him as similar to the movie as possible using the tools and abilities that I posess, but seeing as I am still fairly limited in my coding experience he is still quite far from being realistic. I chose to make his hands and feet a slightly darker color because otherwise they kind of blended into the legs and arms.

## **Steps**
In order to complete the assignment I first followed along with all the videos and read all of the content. After I was done with that and after sketching out monster ideas I followed along with the homework sample. I created all of my sandboxes for my different categories and labeled them appropriately so as to make my work easier to understand. Then I went category by category creating my different shapes and adding colors and shifting shapes until I finally arrived at the bottom of my character sandbox. Before I submitted my work I checked it using my *index.html* and making sure I could see it live on the website.

## **Issues**
I did not have any particularly difficult problems this week so I did not post to the issues board. I found the placement and grid work very tedious and at times extremely confusing but I am sure that just takes time to get used to. I looked through the issues board periodically but it always seemed like they had already been answered by the time I got there.

## **Extra**
I would like to know if there is a way to overlay a grid on top of your work in order to see exactly where you are placing your shapes as I feel that would be extremely helpful instead of just guessing and adjusting.
