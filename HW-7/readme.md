## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

..*Lines 3-10 define all of the variables needed for this Code
..*Lines 12-15 set up the canvas
..*Line 19 begins draw function
..*Lines 21-22 create movement for the ellipse's x and y variables
..*Lines 25-30 keeps the ellipse within the confines of the canvas
..*Lines 31-46 are my changes to the code
..*Lines 48-50 determine the speed of the ellips, clicking in the upper left slows it down while clicking towards the right speeds it up

## How did you alter the sketch?
I started altering the sketch by first changing the color of the ellipse to something a little more fun by using the random color function.
I then noticed that the longer the code ran the messier the screen looked and the less you could tell what was really happening so I added a reset option. I still wanted it to be a little more interactive so I added an if/else statement to change the stroke weight to different sizes depending on wether or not the left or right button was pressed. I also changed the canvas size because I found the restricted canvas size to be annoying and it looked kind of funky.
