# **Summary**

This week was about object oriented programming. I kind of followed examples and created a simple confetti sketch that changes colors and falls to the ground.

# **Steps and Issues**

After reading through the material and trying to understand it the best I could I then went and watched the videos Shiffman makes on YouTube and while that gave me a better understanding I was still quite confused. I spent some time trying to figure it out on my own but then I just decided to try and get help on Thursday so I went to the lab hours and couldn't find anyone to help, even when I went to the lab hours on Tuesday. It turns out that apparently there is a second lab and when I went to lab 127 and it was locked it was because the TA's were in lab 126 so that kind of threw off my homework schedule. The mistakes I made this week were just a few simple syntax errors for the most part but they took me a while to find and fix even with the help of a TA.

# **Extra**

I wish I had known about the other lab because now I feel very behind on the homework. I am very concerned about the final project and trying to catch up.
