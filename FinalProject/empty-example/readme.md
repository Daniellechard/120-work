## **Danielle Chard - Final Project**

[Music Visualizer - 'Gasoline' by Halsey](https://daniellechard.github.io/120-work/FinalProject/empty-example/)

## **Summary**

For our final projects we were supposed to do something more complicated than usual and something outside of our comfort zone. I decided to create a music visualizer after Emily showed me hers and I saw the other music examples on the website. Those were the ones that really spoke to me and that I was interested in. I chose to do the song 'Gasoline' by Halsey and the color palette for the visuals is based off of her album cover. I honestly didn't think I would be able to finish it on time because it seemed really complicated but I thankfully I was able to with the help of Emily and Stephanie.

## **Steps and Issues**

My first issue was trying to get my music to play in atom. I played around with it and made sure that the server was running but that wasn't the problem. I had to get help at the lab hours and eventually Professor Musick came down and helped me figure out everything I had wrong which was a few syntax errors, some file naming issues, and problems loading in the P5.js sound file. After that Emily helped me figure out how to display the frequencies on the screen so we could map them. After that, creating the visuals was surprisingly easy and fun to play with. Throughout this process I learned quite a few new things including how to use the 'GetEnergy' function, preLoad functions, and FFT. I did a different shape for each frequency and I tried to kind of go with an abstract/eclectic vibe which I think fits the music well. All that was left after creating the visuals was to play with the color palette and I am actually very pleased with the result and wouldn't change anything about it.

## **Extra**

It was fun to see how the music affected the visuals and added the music variables to different parts of the shapes to see what changed and why.
