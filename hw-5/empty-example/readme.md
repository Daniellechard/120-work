## **Summary**
This week's homework was to create an animation. I chose to create a little rainbow flower that grows by itself and clouds that move side to side in accordance with the mouse. This week's homework was without a doubt more challenging than any of the previous weeks but that is to be expected as we get farther along in the course.

## **Steps and Issues**

In order to complete this week's homework I tried to read through the course material even though I don't think I truly understood most of it. I began my animation by first creating a still sketch. Then, after attempting to animate it and being completely lost I decided it was time for outside help. I tried to go to the lab hours Tuesday but they were changed, unbeknownst to me, so I then went to Professor Musick's office during his office hours on Thursday and he patiently talked me through the problems I was having and helped me get my animation finally moving.

## **Extra**
I will make it more of a habit to play around with the code more instead of being afraid to break my code. I need to remember that Github always has my work backed up.
