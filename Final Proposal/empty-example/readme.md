## **Proposal**

I would like to make a music visualizer for my final project because I love the concept of being able to actually see sound and use two of your senses to experience music instead of just the one.

## **Related Work/Influence**

Emily really inspired me to want to do a sound visualizer after she showed me her final project from when she took this class. It wasn't something I had ever heard of I found her project very intriguing and visually pleasing. I will also probably taking some inspiration from the 'Manic Depression' music visualizer example as well.

## **Problems**

I know I will have to figure out a way to isolate the different frequencies or instruments in order to visualize them but Emily showed me how she did hers and I was just planning on going to her for advice and help whenever I ran into roadblocks. I will also have to learn how to import sound into atom which I haven't done yet and I can't remember if we covered that but I am assuming it is similar to importing photos. If not, I will just look it up, email a TA, or go to the lab hours in order to get help.

## **Work Plan**

It is hard to strictly define a work plan at this point because I am not yet sure what all I will have to do in order to complete the project but I plan on going to the lab hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays in order to get help with my project since I still feel as if I am very behind. I will also probably email the instructor or TA's to ask for additional help. I may even attend the intructor's office hours depending on how difficult this project turns out. I plan on having the song imported by the 29th and hopefully some of the visuals coded by the 3rd. I will hopefully finish the visuals by the 6th and then use the remaining time to clean up the project and add finishing touches.

## **Work Completed**

I have not yet completed any coding but I have set up my folder and intend on going to the lab hours tomorrow the 29th in order to get help with importing the song and a start on the visuals.
